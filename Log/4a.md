# Disk preparation
## Initial thoughts
* Turns out I don't need any of the advanced features that **BTRFS** offers.
Therefore this time I'll go with **XFS** file system, since it offers high performance and  
features like CoW and reflinks.
* I have ample amount of RAM and i will not use hibernation, but id like to do suspend-to-ram function, therefore I'll do 16 GiB of Swap Space;

## Table
| Device path       | File System | Size     |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| /dev/nvme0n1p1    | vfat        | 1 GiB    |
| /dev/nvme0n1p2    | swap        | 16 GiB   |
| /dev/nvme0n1p3    | xfs         | 100%FREE |
