From The Radical Luhmann by Hans-Georg Moeller

His "soporific" (clunky, tend to induce sleep) writing style is the reason why he's not famous in North America.

Even with german audience were many who do not understood Luhmann's esoteric
writings, which enabled him a lot of things without the risk of being
ostracized by post=1968 German academic community. Luhmann's writing contained
so many radicalisms that he needed to conceal them within inaccessible
language.
