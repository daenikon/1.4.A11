# Disk preparation
## Initial thoughts
* Turns out I don't need any of the advanced features **BTRFS** offers.
Therefore this time I'll go with **XFS** file system, since it offers high performance and  
features like CoW and reflinks.
* I have ample amount of RAM and I don't use suspend or hibernation on my laptop, therefore I don't need swap file/partition.
* I suspect that my previous setup died, because of insufficient size of ESP partition. It used to be 1 GiB, but
since I've kept many copies of previous kernels, it might've been not enough, therefore this time I'll allocate 2 GiB to it.

## Table
| Device path       | File System | Size     |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| /dev/nvme0n1p1    | vfat        | 2 GiB    |
| /dev/nvme0n1p2    | xfs         | 100%FREE |
