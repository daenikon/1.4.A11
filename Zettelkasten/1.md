# Zettelkasten
**Zettelkasten** is a personal knowledge management system, in which notes are interconnected.

## Types of Notes
There are 3 types of notes in Zettelkasten: fleeting, literature and permanent.
1. **Fleeting**: temporary notes used to catch and write down the idea quickly. 
2. **Literature**: ideas or concepts from a book or media rephrased in own words.
3. **Permanent**: refined notes from related literature or fleeting notes.

## Rules
Much like the chain is only as strong as its weakest link, the system is as strong as its nodes.
Therefore there are certain rules one should follow:
1. One atomic idea per note
2. Always include references
3. Permanent notes must be independent and not rely on external context

## Recommendations
1. In order not to slack, think that you write notes to other people/future-you
2. Regularly review
*'Productivity of a knowledge worker can be measured by how many permanent notes he has written that day'*
3. Include metadata in permanent notes
