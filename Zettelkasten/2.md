# Problem
Yanking and pasting a large amount of text in Neovim is fast, since it doesn't use the system clipboard by default.
It is fast, but there are quite often cases that require pasting text from Neovim to other applications.
There is an option for that  - `clipboard = unnamedplus` (weird name, wonder what's the reason for that)
But with such change come other implications regarding performance - it might take longer time to paste/yank

> There are three documented X11 selections: PRIMARY, SECONDARY, and CLIPBOARD.
> CLIPBOARD is typically used in X11 applications for copy/paste operations
> (CTRL-c/CTRL-v), while PRIMARY is used for the last selected text, which is
> generally inserted with the middle mouse button.

> Nvim's X11 clipboard providers only use the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections,
> for the "*" and "+" registers, respectively.

# Solutions
Therefore there are some solutions to this:
## Selective Clipboard Usage
Neovim's `"+p` and `"+y` commands to explicitly yank and paste from the system clipboard
Gives more control, but might need to make some keybinds
## Registers
`:h registers`

# Best Way
```lua
vim.keymap.set("v", "<Leader>y", '"+y')
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Leader>p", '"+p')
```
I've set keymaps to yank and paste into Clipboard (the one with Ctrl+V/Ctrl+C)

# Notes
Think about using clipboard manager that allows to keep a history or to pin/save important items.
