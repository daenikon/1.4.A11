# Digital Zettelkasten: Principles, Methods, & Examples
Author: David Kadavy

# Structure
Aside from creating folders for original Zettelkasten's Literature and
Permanent notes, Kadavy recommends creating 3 more folder: Inbox, Someday/Maybe
and Raw.

1. Inbox folder consists of notes that need to be processed (fleeting notes)
2. Someday/Maybe folder is borrowed from **Getting Things Done** book for notes that are interesting but not currently relevant.
3. Raw is for storing "raw" highlights from books or articles.
