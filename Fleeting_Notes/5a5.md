There are 3 main naming conventions for Zettelkasten:
1. Descriptive name (e.g. "naming-conventions-zettelkasten.md")
2. Unique ID (e.g. 202416022315)
3. Folgezettel (e.g. 11f2a3)

One can also use a mix of those. Descriptive naming seems to be fit-for-all
solution in a digital world. Nevertheless, for now, I use the same method
Niklas Luhmann used - Folgezettel. Since my ZK-workflow is based on index
files, i can use folgezettel to have basic connections between notes and also
have a description by side (e.g. [5a12b | Vim Modes](5a12b.md)).
