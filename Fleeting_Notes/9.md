*'Scientific America did a study in the early 70s on the efficiency of
locomotion. For all the different species on the planet they measured how much
energy does it take to get from here to there and they ranked them in a list.
The Condor won, took the least amount of energy to get from here to there. And
men came out with unimpressive showing about a third of the way down the list,
but fortunately Scientific America was insightful enough to test man with the
bicycle and man with the bicycle won, twice as good as the Condor and what it
showed is that man is a toolmaker and has the ability to amplify an inherent
ability that he has and it's exactly what we're doing here (refers to Apple
Computers)'*
