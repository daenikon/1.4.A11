In order to have a strong system, there are certain rules for notes and connection between them:
1. Fleeting and Literature notes should contain just one atomic idea per note (max 3-5 sentences).
2. Literature notes must include the reference to the source.
3. Permanent notes must be written with no previous context in mind.
