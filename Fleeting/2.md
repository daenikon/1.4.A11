# Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is a personal knowledge management system.

In Zettelkasten note-taking system there are three different types of notes:

## Fleeting
Temporary notes in order to catch the idea quickly.
They don't need to be refined, but clear and consise idea goes a long way.
After the review process (permanent note creation) the fleeting note can be discarded.

## Literature
Ideas/Concepts from a source rephrased in your own words.

## Permanent
Clear and context-independent note refined from related fleeting and/or literature notes.


# Rules
1. Fleeting and Literature notes should contain just one atomic idea per note (max 3-5 sentences).
2. Literature notes must include the reference to the source.
3. Permanent notes must be written with no previous context in mind.

# Recommendations
1. Write all notes like for other people.
2. Regularly review fleeting/literature notes.
    'Productuvity of a knowledge worker can be measured by the amount of permanent notes he has written in a day`
